# CONCEPT

The project concept is a website that displays various statistics regarding the AP item changes, using Riot's provided AP item data set. These statistics will primarily be sorted by champion, and will include champion winrate and item winrate on that champion. It will also show some stats regarding items that were not changed in the changes.

**Planned stats**
 - Champion winrate before/after
 - Item winrate before/after
 - Item popularity
 - Item winrate on specific champions before/after
 - Item popularity on specific champions before/after


**Project goal**  
Provide a clean interface with statistics a player can use if they desire statistical information regarding the changes.
