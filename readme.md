#RIOT GAMES API CHALLENGE
##AP Item Update Statistics

**IMPORTANT:** This project's code is messy and a bit rushed as it was created for a contest, and I did not have time to program on it for the entire contest period. If I had more time I would have cleaned up the code considerably to something more presentable.

**The result will be presented on [HumaneWolf.com/apupdate/](http://humanewolf.com/apupdate/)**  
**Tempporarily offline while  I'm changing and fixing a server**
